This project will walk through setting up a swarm cluster using Windows 2016 server. It will show how to use Docker REST API's for creating service and as a result containers getting launched. 
It will walk you through on how to build a image having Tomcat9 installed. 
Plan is to run 2 master nodes having tomcat running, and setting up NGNIX server to load balance traffic across the cluster.
